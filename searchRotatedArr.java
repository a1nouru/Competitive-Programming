/*
Question from leetcode. 
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n). 
Thought---->I preper to think of this as a clue to solving this problem.
I have learnt to always pay extra attention to the question at hand, sometimes solution is embedded in. 
If you've done binary search before, this should be quite similar 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1

*/

public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
    return binarySearch(nums, 0, nums.length-1, target);
}
 
public int binarySearch(int[] nums, int left, int right, int target){
    if(left>right) 
        return -1;
 
    int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
 
    if(target == nums[mid])
        return mid;
 
    if(nums[left] <= nums[mid]){
        if(nums[left]<=target && target<nums[mid]){
          return binarySearch(nums,left, mid-1, target);
        }else{
          return  binarySearch(nums, mid+1, right, target);
        }
    }else {
        if(nums[mid]<target&& target<=nums[right]){
          return  binarySearch(nums,mid+1, right, target);
        }else{
          return  binarySearch(nums, left, mid-1, target);
        }
    }
}
