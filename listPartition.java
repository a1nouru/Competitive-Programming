/*
Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

Example:

Input: head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, x = 3
Output: 1->2->2->4->3->5

/*
Another way you could look at this is, by creating two dummy nodes as before but then judging if it's greater or smaller. 
If greater i toges to the first dummy node if smaller it goes to the second node and then you can intersect the 
two dummy nodes later after your done traversing the list. 

Have FUN!!!!
