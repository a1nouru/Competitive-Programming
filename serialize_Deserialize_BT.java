/*

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so 
that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link 
to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your 
serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can 
be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Example: 

You may serialize the following tree:

    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5

as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
Clarification: The above format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

 * public class TreeNode {

/*The idea is simple: print the tree in pre-order traversal and use "X" to denote null node and split node with ",". We can use a StringBuilder for building the string on the fly. For deserializing, we use a Queue to store the pre-order traversal and since we have "X" as null node, we know exactly how to where to end building subtress.
